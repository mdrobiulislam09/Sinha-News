        <h1>What is difference in var, let and const?</h1>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>In the var tab, when you will run the code, you will see an error as a is not defined because var variables are only accessible in the function scope.</li>
                <li>In the let tab, when you run the code, you will see an error as i is not defined because let variables are only accessible within the block they are declared.</li>
                <li>In the const tab, when you run the code, you will see that x was defined under the block was accessible, but when you try to access x outside that block, you will get an error.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h1>what is difference between Regular function and arrow function?</h1>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Regular functions created using function declarations or expressions are constructible and callable. Regular functions are constructible; they can be called using the new keyword.</li>
                <li>the arrow functions are only callable and not constructible, i.e., arrow functions can never be used as constructor functions.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h1>What is difference in find(), filter(), map(), forEach()?</h1>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>The find() method is used to find all the descendant elements of the selected element. It finds the element in the DOM tree by traversing through the root to leaf.</li>
                <li>The filter() checks every element in an array to see if it meets a certain criteria and returns a new array with the elements that return truthy for the criteria.</li>
                <li>The map() executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated elements.</li>
                <li>The forEach(), is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and it returns undefined.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h1>Why do we use template string?</h1>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript released in ES6. It lets us insert/interpolate variables and expressions into strings without needing to concatenate like in older versions of JavaScript. It allows us to create strings that are complex and contain dynamic elements</li>
            </ul>
